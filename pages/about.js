      <p className="mb-4 leading-6 md:text-lg md:leading-7">
        From the age of thirteen, I first realised my interest in photography
        paging through numerous editions of National Geographic magazines
        totally engrossed and captivated in the photographic images.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-6 md:text-lg md:leading-7">
        Living in vibrant and busy London, I continue to explore numerous
        photographic techniques whilst taking advantage of the fast pace of
        change, interesting subjects and urban architecture that the city has to
        offer.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-6 md:text-lg md:leading-7">
        In the past five years, I have developed a keen eye and natural feel for
        abstract, nature, travel and urban landscape photography and am looking
        to use the skills I have learnt to choose a photography genre that
        agrees to me.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 leading-6 md:text-lg md:leading-7">
        Offering amateur and aspiring models the opportunity to obtain a
        professional looking portfolio by providing ‘time for portfolio’ (TFP)
        shoots, I intend to highlight the model's unique qualities and to
        capture the viewers interest with minimum photographic software
        manipulation whilst utilizing my skills as a portrait photographer. Go
        to people in my galleries to see the work I have done with some amateur
        models.
      </p>

      {/* <p className="mb-4 leading-6 md:text-lg md:leading-7">
        Working for myself as a freelancer or for a publication, I continue to
        work at improving my capabilities to become a professional photographer.
        Whether as a travel photographer capturing images of the local and
        indigenous people and animals that live in the countries I visit, or
        continue working with people as a portrait photographer its become a
        long term goal to achieve this dream.
